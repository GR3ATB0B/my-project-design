# OpenClaw HQ

## Description
OpenClaw HQ is the local command center for your OpenClaw AI assistant. It gives you full visibility and control over your agents, tasks, token usage, and persistent memory — all from a single, clean dashboard running on your machine.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: No Visibility Into What Your Agent Is Doing
OpenClaw runs autonomously in the background, but without a central interface you're left guessing what it's working on. HQ provides a real-time dashboard with activity feeds, agent status, and task progress at a glance.

### Problem 2: Task Management Is Scattered Across Chat Apps
Tasks get assigned through WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, and more — making it hard to track what's waiting, in progress, or stuck. HQ consolidates everything into a customizable kanban board with user-defined statuses and columns.

### Problem 3: No Way to Track Token Costs
Running AI agents burns tokens across multiple LLM providers, and costs can spiral without awareness. HQ surfaces usage analytics, cost breakdowns by agent and model, so you stay in control of spend.

### Problem 4: Agent Memory Is a Black Box
Your agent learns your preferences over time, but there's no way to see or manage what it remembers. HQ opens up the memory layer so you can view, edit, and delete stored knowledge.

### Problem 5: Managing Skills and Integrations Is Manual
Discovering, installing, and configuring agent skills requires digging through files and configs. HQ provides a clean interface to browse available skills, manage active integrations, and connect services.
